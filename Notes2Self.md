# 401K Payment Tracker Project Notes

## Project Structure
The app has been modularized into the following components:

- `app.py`: Main application file that handles routing and page configuration
- `sidebar.py`: Navigation sidebar component
- `utils.py`: Shared database functions and utilities
- `pages/`: Directory containing individual page components
  - `quarterly_summary.py`: Overview of all clients' payment status
  - `client_dashboard.py`: Detailed client information with contacts, contracts, and payment history
  - `manage_clients.py`: (Coming soon) Client management interface
  - `bulk_payment_entry.py`: (Coming soon) Bulk payment data entry interface

## User Preferences
- Prefers clean code with minimal comments
- CSS is kept within individual files as needed, no global CSS file
- Functionality should remain identical to the original monolithic version

## Database Structure
The app uses SQLite with the following tables:
- clients
- contracts
- contacts
- payments

## Recent Changes
- Separated monolithic app.py into modular components
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code organization
- Created placeholder pages for upcoming features (manage clients and bulk payment entry)
- Each component maintains its own CSS styling as needed
