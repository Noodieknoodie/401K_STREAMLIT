# THIS CODE FILE IS MID-REFACTORING. PLEASE ENSURE TO UPDATE CODE YOU SEE TO ADAPT TO THE NEW APPROACH. 
# IF THE CODE ALREADY DOES ANY OF THIS CORRECTLY, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT. ASSUME THAT THE REFRACTORING WAS APPLIED CORRECTLY AND BE HAPPY THAT YOU ARE NOT HAVING TO DO IT AGAIN.

# NEW APPROACH:

Use simple session state, NO MORE UIManager
Let Streamlit handle reruns
Use built-in forms
Stop trying to outsmart the framework


# ENSURE TO PRESERVE THE FOLLOWING:

## Critical Database Relationships to preserve
### Key relationships that must be maintained
clients -> contacts (1:many)
clients -> contracts (1:many)
contracts -> payments (1:many)

## Critical validations to preserve
- Contract fee types (percentage/flat)
- Payment periods (monthly/quarterly)
- Payment ranges (start/end quarters)

## Essential Business Logic to Preserve
- Fee calculations based on contract type
- Period handling (monthly/quarterly)
- Multi-quarter payment support
- Payment validation in arrears
- Contact type restrictions (Primary/Authorized/Provider)

## Period Handling to preserve
- Keep the existing period logic but with the simplified state management

# PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:

The old version was inconsistent because it fought Streamlit's rerun behavior
The new version will be more reliable because:
Uses Streamlit's native form handling
Simpler state management
Clear data flow
No complex UI manager
The real key to consistency is:
Use Streamlit forms properly
Keep state management simple
Let Streamlit handle reruns
Don't fight the framework
