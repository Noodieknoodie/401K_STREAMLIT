# Performance Optimization Log

## Database and Query Optimizations

### Payment History Caching
- Implemented LRU cache with 128-entry capacity for payment queries
- Added smart cache key generation based on filter parameters
- Graceful fallback to direct queries if cache fails
- Caching includes filtered results for years and quarters

### Database Connection Management
- Optimized connection handling to prevent connection leaks
- Ensured proper connection closing after queries
- Reduced unnecessary database connections

## UI and State Management Optimizations

### Filter State Management
- Created dedicated `filter_state` in session state
- Added `needs_reload` flag to track necessary data refreshes
- Prevented unnecessary data reloads when filters haven't changed
- Maintained filter state between component rerenders

### Note Handling
- Optimized note state management
- Prevented unnecessary note state clearing
- Preserved note states during filter changes when possible
- Reduced component rerenders for note editing

### Component Optimization
- Added proper keys to all filter components
- Implemented efficient `on_change` handlers
- Maintained exact UI layout while improving performance
- Optimized filter control responsiveness

## Data Loading and Pagination

### Smart Data Loading
- Implemented paginated data loading (25 items per page)
- Added caching for paginated results
- Optimized initial data load
- Preserved pagination state during filter changes

### Filter Performance
- Optimized year/quarter filtering logic
- Reduced unnecessary data reloads
- Improved filter change response time
- Maintained filter state during navigation

## Memory Management

### Session State Optimization
- Implemented efficient session state management
- Reduced unnecessary state clearing
- Optimized state persistence between page loads
- Smart clearing of outdated states

### Cache Management
- Implemented size-limited LRU cache (128 entries)
- Added cache key generation for query parameters
- Efficient cache invalidation strategy
- Memory-conscious caching approach

## Maintained Functionality
