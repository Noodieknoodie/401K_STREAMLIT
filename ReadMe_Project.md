# Core design philosophy, architecture and layout:

### WE WANT A CONSISTENT VERTICAL RHYTHM BETWEEN SECTIONS.
### WRAP SECTIONS PROPERLY WITH CONTAINERS.
### THE SPACING SHOULD CREATE A GENTLE VISUAL GROUPING WHILE MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT RHYTHM DOWN THE PAGE.

### USE FIXED HEIGHT OR MIN-HEIGHT WHEN SUITABLE
### USE FLEX LAYOUT WITH CONSISTENT SPACING WHEN SUITABLE
### ENSURE THE DELTA SPACE IS RESERVED EVEN WHEN EMPTY WHEN NEEDED


Layout Hierarchy Principles
Always use st.columns() inside containers rather than standalone
Maintain a consistent grid system (prefer [2,2,2,2] or [3,3,3] over irregular splits)
Use streamlit-extras grid/row when you need precise vertical alignment
Minimize empty vertical space - if spacing is needed, use add_vertical_space with intention


Component Best Practices
Favor native Streamlit components over custom CSS whenever possible
Use streamlit-extras metric_cards instead of raw st.metric() for better visual consistency
Place related interactive elements (buttons, inputs) in the same container/grid cell
Keep form layouts symmetrical with consistent widths


Styling Philosophy
Start with native Streamlit styling before adding custom CSS
When CSS is needed, use streamlit-extras stylable_container to isolate styles
Maintain consistent padding/margins (0.5rem, 1rem) across similar components
Use border-radius and subtle shadows to create visual hierarchy without heaviness


Space Optimization
Combine logically related headers/controls into single row containers
Use expanders strategically for secondary information
Leverage multi-column layouts to reduce vertical scrolling
Maintain minimum 2-3 lines between major sections, but eliminate unnecessary gaps


Interaction Patterns
Keep primary actions visible without scrolling
Group related controls together in logical containers
Maintain consistent button/input sizing within sections
Use progressive disclosure (show/hide) rather than multiple pages when possible

The goal is intentional, clean layouts that guide users naturally through workflows while maximizing screen real estate and minimizing custom styling needs.



Remove unnecessary st.write("") spacing calls - these take up vertical space
Use add_vertical_space from streamlit-extras for precise spacing control when needed
Consolidate section headers with their content by using styled containers

## NOTE!! 

- Many Streamlit commands prefixed with 'experimental' are outdated. For example, `st.experimental.rerun` is deprecatedâ€”use `st.rerun` instead.
- ALL PAYMENTS ARE IN ARREARS.

# 401k Payment Tracking System - Architecture & Implementation Guide

## System Overview
This application manages 401k payment tracking with a sophisticated period-based architecture, using quarters as the foundational storage unit while supporting flexible display based on payment schedules.

## Core Architecture Components

### Period Management
- All periods stored as quarters in database for consistency
- Dynamic display converts quarters to months for monthly payment schedules
- Handles both single periods ("Jan 2024", "Q1 2024") and ranges ("Jan-Mar 2024", "Q1-Q2 2024")
- Automatic conversion between storage (quarters) and display formats (months/quarters)

### State Management
The application uses a centralized UIStateManager class that provides:
- Strongly typed dialog states using TypedDict
- Separate payment and contact dialog management
- Form data persistence and validation
- Confirmation handling for unsaved changes
- Clean separation between dialog types
- Automatic state cleanup on dialog close

((( REMOVING ))) The UIStateManager ensures:
- Type safety through TypedDict definitions
- Consistent dialog lifecycle management
- Proper validation state handling
- Form data preservation during updates
- Clear separation of concerns

### Row Structure
Each payment row is contained within its own container, ensuring:
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Proper note expansion behavior
- Clean separation between rows
- Predictable layout scaling

### Data Formatting
Data formatting occurs once at fetch time and is cached:
- Currency values formatted and stored
- Periods converted and cached
- Dates formatted
- Discrepancies calculated
This prevents redundant formatting operations during scrolling or filtering.

### Note System
Notes use a single, consistent implementation that:
- Toggles between green (ðŸŸ¢) and hollow (â—¯) icons based on content
- Expands smoothly below the row
- Spans partial row width for clean visual hierarchy
- Maintains state within row containers

## Key Implementation Details

### Filter Handling
Filters are processed separately from display logic:
- Time period selections (All Time, This Year, Custom)
- Proper handling of both monthly and quarterly frequencies
- Clean separation between filter logic and display code

### Payment Schedules
The system seamlessly handles both payment schedules:

Monthly:
- Jan 2024         (single month)
- Jan-Mar 2024     (range same year)
- Dec 2023-Jan 2024 (range across years)

Quarterly:
- Q1 2024         (single quarter)
- Q1-Q2 2024      (range same year)
- Q4 2023-Q1 2024 (range across years)
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Period Handling
   - Don't assume quarters-only display
   - Remember to convert based on contract payment schedule
   - Maintain proper month-quarter relationships

2. State Management
   - Don't initialize state in multiple locations
   - Use the centralized state initialization
   - Respect state scoping for client switches

3. Row Structure
   - Keep note expansion within row containers
   - Maintain column ratio consistency
   - Preserve container hierarchy

4. Data Formatting
   - Don't reformat data unnecessarily
   - Use cached formatted values
   - Only reformat on actual data changes

5. Note System
   - Use the single note implementation
   - Maintain proper expansion behavior
   - Keep consistent state management

## Key Technical Considerations

### Database Structure
- Quarters as base storage unit
- Contract payment schedules determine display
- Client relationships maintain data hierarchy

### UI Components
- Row containers provide structural integrity
- Note expansion maintains visual hierarchy
- Filter controls respect payment schedules

### State Flow
- Centralized initialization
- Clear state boundaries between clients
- Cached formatting for performance

## Development Guidelines

1. Always consider both monthly and quarterly schedules when modifying period-related code
2. Maintain the centralized state initialization pattern
3. Keep row containers intact for proper layout behavior
4. Use cached formatted data instead of reformatting
5. Follow the single note system implementation
6. Respect the separation between filter logic and display

## Performance Considerations
- Formatted data caching prevents redundant operations
- Container structure enables efficient updates
- State centralization reduces unnecessary reinitializations
- Filter separation enables optimized queries
