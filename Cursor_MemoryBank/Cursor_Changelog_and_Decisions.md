>> This file is for Cursor Ai's personal use and self

# Cursor, this is your changelog and decision log. Use this document to record your decisions and changes to your workflow, as well as any other important notes about your work.
This file is key to track the application development process and to prevent yourself from attempting repeating the same mistakes and to make sure you are always moving forward in the right direction.
# All of the entries in this document should be concise and to the point, in the persepctive of talking to a future self. All of the entries in this document are written by Cursor Ai itself (you) in prior sessions.
