# Payment Schedule Validation Fix TODO

## Root Cause
The payment schedule validation is happening in multiple places and there's a potential race condition between contract validation and payment validation.

## Action Items
1. Consolidate validation logic into a single source of truth in `utils.py`
2. Add pre-validation check in payment form before allowing form display
3. Update error messages to be more descriptive about the exact state of the contract
4. Add logging to track the validation flow

## Files to Modify
- `pages_new/client_display_and_forms/client_payments.py`
- `utils/utils.py`
- `pages_new/client_display_and_forms/client_contracts.py`

## Testing Steps
1. Test contract creation with/without payment schedule
2. Test payment creation with/without valid contract
3. Test edge cases around schedule changes
4. Verify error messages are clear and actionable

## Additional Considerations
- Review state management approach
- Consider adding contract status checks
- Add validation status caching
- Improve error handling UX

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on single source of truth for validation
- Ensure clear error messages
- Add proper logging
- Consider edge cases
- Test thoroughly before deployment
